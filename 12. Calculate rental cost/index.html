    <!-- A car rental company needs to calculate the cost of a rental based on the
    number of days rented and the type of car. They reeuire a function that
    takes in the number of days rented and car type and returns the rental cost.
    The total cost would be the rental cost multiplied by the number of days
    rented. 

      The rental costs are
      Economy = Rs. 4000 /- per day
      Midsize = Rs. 10,000 /- per day
      Luxury = Rs. 20,000 /- per day. -->

    <script>
      function calculateRentalCost(daysRented, carType) {
        let rentalCostPerDay;

        switch (carType) {
          case "Economy":
            rentalCostPerDay = 4000;
            break;
          case "Midsize":
            rentalCostPerDay = 10000;
            break;
          case "Luxury":
            rentalCostPerDay = 20000;
            break;
          default:
            return "Invalid car type";
        }

        const rentalCost = rentalCostPerDay * daysRented;
        return rentalCost;
      }

      const daysRented = 5;
      const carType = "Midsize";
      const rentalCost = calculateRentalCost(daysRented, carType);
      console.log(rentalCost); // Output: 50000
