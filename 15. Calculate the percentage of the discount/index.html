    <!-- A retail store is offering a discount on its products and wants to calculate
    the percentage of the discount to show customers how much they can save.
    Given the original price and the discounted price of a product, implement an
    arrow function to calculate the percentage of the discount rounded off to
    two decimal places. This function could be useful for the store's marketing
    team to create promotions and offers that attract customers. -->

    <!-- In this example, the product is discounted by 40%, which is calculated as  follows: 
    Original price = 50 
    Discounted price = 30 
    Discount = 50 - 30 = 20
    Discount percentage = (20 / 50) * 100 = 40% -->

    <script>
      const calculateDiscountPercentage = (originalPrice, discountedPrice) => {
        const discount = originalPrice - discountedPrice;
        const discountPercentage = (discount / originalPrice) * 100;
        return Math.round(discountPercentage * 100) / 100; // round off to two decimal places
      };

      const originalPrice = 50;
      const discountedPrice = 30;
      const discountPercentage = calculateDiscountPercentage(
        originalPrice,
        discountedPrice
      );
      console.log(`The product is discounted by ${discountPercentage}%`);
      // Output: The product discount is 40%
