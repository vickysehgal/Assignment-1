    <!-- 4. Highest Marks
    A teacher wants to find out the highest marks scored by a
    student in a class of five students. The teacher enters the marks of all
    five students in an array called "marks". Write a program that iterates
    through the array and finds the highest marks scored by any student in the
    class. The highest marks must then be displayed to the teacher using the
    console. Make sure you use the ternary operator to find the student with the
    highest marks -->

    <script>
      const marks = [80, 90, 70, 95, 85];

      let highestMarks = 0;

      for (let i = 0; i < marks.length; i++) {
        highestMarks = marks[i] > highestMarks ? marks[i] : highestMarks;
      }

      console.log(`The highest marks of a student in the class is ${highestMarks}`);
