    <!-- You are working on an e-commerce website where customers can add items to their cart. The cart stores the
    quantity of each item that the customer wants to purchase in an array of numbers. However, the website is
    currently experiencing a bug where the euantity of each item is being recorded incorrectly by reducing it to
    half. As a result, you need to write a JavaScript function that can double the euantity of each item in the cart
    array to correct thq bug. -->

    <script>
      function fixCartQuantities(cart) {
        for (let i = 0; i < cart.length; i++) {
          cart[i] *= 2;
        }
        return cart;
      }

      const cartQuantity = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

      const fixedCart = fixCartQuantities(cartQuantity);
      console.log(fixedCart);
