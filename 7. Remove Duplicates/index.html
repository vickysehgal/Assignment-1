    <!-- In an online shopping application, customers can add multiple items to their
    cart. ;owever, sometimes customers accidentally add the same item more than
    once, resulting in duplicate items in their cart. The duplicate items not
    only make it difficult for the customer to track the items they want to
    purchase but also affect the accuracy of the purchase order. -->

    <!-- To solve this problem, the application needs to remove duplicate items from
    the customer's cart. The pro[ram should take the customer's cart with
    duplicates as input, and return a new cart without duplicates. -->

    <!-- Write a program to solve the problem of duplicate items in the cart by removing duplicates. -->

    <script>
      function removeDuplicates(cart) {
        let uniqueCart = [];
        cart.forEach(function (item) {
          if (!uniqueCart.includes(item)) {
            uniqueCart.push(item);
          }
        });
        return uniqueCart;
      }

      let customerCart = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'banana', 'kiwi', 'orange'];
      let uniqueCart = removeDuplicates(customerCart);
